# Convention Audit

`opencli convention-audit` scans adapter metadata plus source files for common
agent-native convention violations.

The command is intentionally report-first. It gives agents a shared fact base
before starting a sweep PR; `--strict` can be used later by CI gates.

## Usage

```bash
opencli convention-audit
opencli convention-audit --site twitter
opencli convention-audit twitter/search
opencli convention-audit --site pixiv -f yaml
opencli convention-audit --strict
```

Formats:

- `table` prints a grouped human-readable report.
- `yaml` is the recommended agent-facing format.
- `json` is available for stricter machine consumers.

## Rules

The first version reports these categories:

- `silent-column-drop`: source rows emit top-level keys that are not present in `columns`.
- `camelCase-in-columns`: output columns should use stable snake_case keys.
- `missing-access-metadata`: every adapter command must declare `access: 'read' | 'write'`.
- `silent-clamp`: `Math.min(...limit...)` can silently change user input instead of throwing `ArgumentError`.
- `silent-empty-fallback`: `return []` can hide fetch/parse failures from agents.
- `silent-sentinel`: `?? 'unknown'` / `|| 'N/A'` style fallbacks can turn missing data into fake data.
- `write-without-delete-pair`: write commands such as `like`, `save`, `follow`, `create`, or `post` should have an undo/delete counterpart when the site supports one.

The scanners are heuristic. Treat reports as prioritized review input by
default, then turn a specific rule into a strict CI gate only after the current
violations and exemptions are understood.
